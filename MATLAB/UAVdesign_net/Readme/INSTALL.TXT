1. Add the UAVdesign_net folder to the Matlab path

2. If you are going to use the GigE Camera block, you have to download the AVT PvAPI SDK for GigE Vision cameras
   from http://www.alliedvisiontec.com/us/products/software/avt-pvapi-sdk.html and copy the PvApi.h file from the
   AVT GigE SDK/inc-pc folder into the UAVdesign_net folder.

3. Run UAVdesign_net_build.m to compile the S-functions.

4. If you are going to use the GigE Camera block, install the shared library for it.
   For Windows: copy the corresponding PvAPI.dll file from the GigE folder into the System32 folder.
   For Linux: copy the corresponding libPvAPI.so file from the Linux folder into the /usr/lib or /usr/lib64 folder.

5. For Linux only: modify the template makefiles in order to include some libraries during compilation.
 
   The modifications are made to the ???_unix.tmf files in the matlab/rtw/c/(target_name) folder(s).
   You need to replace one line in the "Additional Libraries" section:
   Replace the original line
        SYSLIBS = $(EXT_LIB) -lm
   with
        SYSLIBS = $(EXT_LIB) -lm -lrt -lpthread -ldl

6. For Linux only: If you are going to use the GigE Camera block, modify the TCP/IP support routines files as shown
   in the UAVdesign_net/Matlab/rtw/c/src/rtiostream/rtiostreamtcpip folder.
   This is needed in order to prevent the signals generated by the GigE library from interfering with the
   TCP/IP communication if the model is run in Rapid Acceleration mode or in External Mode.


The library should appear in the Simulink Library Browser.
